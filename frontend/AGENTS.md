# Frontend Rules (frontend/)

Normative rules for working on the Next.js frontend. Architecture and flow walkthroughs live in [docs/7-DEVELOPMENT/frontend.md](../docs/7-DEVELOPMENT/frontend.md) — this file is only what you must know before changing code. Project-wide rules are in the root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Commands (run inside `frontend/`)

- Dev server: `npm run dev` (port 3000; API must be up at 5055 first)
- Lint: `npm run lint` (`eslint src/`)
- Tests: `npm run test` (`vitest run`) · coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
- Build: `npm run build`

## Hard rules

- **i18n is mandatory**: every UI string goes through `t('section.key')` and the key must exist in **all locales** under `src/lib/locales/` (currently 14; en-US is the reference). Missing keys fall back to en-US silently — keep locales in sync. Each non-en-US locale ends with `satisfies TranslationShape` (type derived from en-US), so a missing/extra key fails `tsc`; the parity test (`src/lib/locales/index.test.ts`) checks the same at runtime.
- All requests go through `apiClient` (`src/lib/api/client.ts`); never create a second axios instance. Auth token is auto-added from localStorage key `auth-storage`.
- Data fetching uses TanStack Query hooks in `src/lib/hooks/` with `QUERY_KEYS`; mutations invalidate caches and show toasts (sonner). Follow the existing hook shape.
- FormData requests: nested objects/arrays must be `JSON.stringify`-ed before appending; the interceptor strips Content-Type so the browser sets the multipart boundary — don't re-add it.
- No automatic request retry — handle failures in the consuming code (podcast retry is an explicit endpoint/hook, not a client retry).

## Gotchas

- Zustand stores with `persist`: check `hasHydrated` before rendering persisted state (SSR hydration mismatch), and keep each store's `name` key unique (localStorage collision).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT_MS`: default 600000 (10 min) for slow LLM calls; `0` disables the timeout.
- SSE (`useAsk`): incomplete lines stay in the buffer between reads; incomplete JSON is silently skipped — don't "simplify" the buffer handling.
- `useSourceStatus` polls every 2s while status is `running`/`queued`/`new`.
- Cache invalidation is deliberately broad (e.g. `['sources']` hits all source queries) — a simplicity/perf trade-off, be precise only when it matters.
- Dark mode requires the `dark` class on the document root, not just `prefers-color-scheme`. It's hand-rolled: the zustand `theme-store` (persisted as `theme-storage`) sets the class via `ThemeProvider` — no next-themes.
- Dialogs don't auto-reset form state (parent clears it) and auto-focus the first input (layout shift risk with conditional inputs). Fixed overlays use `z-50`.
- Provider nesting order in `app/layout.tsx` matters: ErrorBoundary → ThemeProvider → QueryProvider → I18nProvider → ConnectionGuard → Toaster. ErrorBoundary is a class component and uses the raw `enUS` locale object (no hooks).
- `i18n` runs with `useSuspense: false` (no SSR for translations).

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
