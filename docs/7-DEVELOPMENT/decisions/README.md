# Decision Records

The project's decision log: short, dated, immutable records of structural decisions. They answer *"why is it like this?"* months later, and prevent settled discussions from being reopened without knowing they were settled.

Two kinds, same format:

- **ADR** (Architecture Decision Record) — technical choices: `ADR-NNN-slug.md`
- **PDR** (Product Decision Record) — product direction and scope: `PDR-NNN-slug.md`

The **current rules** distilled from these records live in [VISION.md](../../../VISION.md) (product identity + posture) and [design-principles.md](../design-principles.md) (engineering practices). Records are the memory; those pages are the law.

## Rules

1. **Records are immutable.** Reversing a decision means writing a *new* record and marking the old one `Superseded by ADR-NNN` in its Status line — never editing history.
2. **Write it in the same PR.** A design that resolves an open structural question ships with its record. Half a page, written while the context is loaded — not a documentation session later.
3. **Keep it to half a page.** Four sections: Context, Decision, Alternatives considered, Consequences. If it needs more, link an issue or doc for the depth.
4. **Number sequentially** within each prefix (ADR-005 comes after ADR-004, independent of PDRs).

## Template

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: <Title>

- **Status**: Accepted | Superseded by ADR-NNN
- **Date**: YYYY-MM
- **Related**: #issue, other records

## Context
What was the situation and the forces at play? (2-5 sentences)

## Decision
What we decided, stated as a rule someone can follow.

## Alternatives considered
What else was on the table and why it lost. (bullets)

## Consequences
What this makes easier, what it makes harder, what to watch. (bullets)
```
