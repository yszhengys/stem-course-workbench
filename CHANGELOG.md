and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **New "Quiet Green" design foundation** — the first of three PRs applying the visual identity co-designed with the community in Discussion #1202. The design token system lands in `globals.css` (core palette, neutral reading surfaces, ink ramp, hairline borders, content-type hues, evidence/citation classes, context-state colors, a squared 4–6px radius scale and a near-flat shadow scale where popovers own the only real shadow); fonts move from Inter to Bricolage Grotesque (display) + Instrument Sans (UI) + Spline Sans Mono (data) via `next/font`; the shadcn primitives are restyled to the foundation's rules (fern green primary actions, red reserved exclusively for destructive/error, clay for warnings, teal as the AI/system voice, underline tabs, quiet neutral badges, teal focus ring); and hard-coded palette colors across 38 components were swept into the semantic tokens, which re-resolve automatically per theme. A dev-only living styleguide at `/dev/design` (404 in production) renders every token and primitive in both themes and serves as the review reference for the follow-up screen-by-screen PRs. Purely visual — no behavior, navigation or i18n changes
- **Screen-by-screen reskin in the "Quiet Green" language** (the second redesign PR): the app shell gets the recomposed tri-hue pebble wordmark (fern/gold/teal — no red left), a fern spine on the active nav item and destination-hued nav icons; the notebook workspace gets display-type titles, panel headers with identity ticks (sources sage / notes gold / chat teal), one-line source-card metadata with the overflow menu at top-right, and de-washed chat bubbles (the AI speaks in teal accents, never washed backgrounds); the notebooks home separates compact recently-viewed rows from active-notebook cards; the sources table gets the library treatment (content-type pebbles, quiet embedded pills, hover that raises the surface); dialogs and the source viewer are flattened (no card-in-card boxes, uniform breathing room, no ⋮/close collision); and Models/Settings/Podcasts/Transformations/Ask-Search get the badge diet, quiet audio-player containers, mono for data and teal AI accents. Still purely visual — no behavior, columns, navigation or i18n changes

### Changed
- Community contribution intake now separates exploration from execution: feature requests, product/design/architecture ideas and contribution proposals start in GitHub Discussions, while Issues are reserved for reproducible bugs and maintainer-approved work items. The Issue chooser routes contributors accordingly, a structured Ideas Discussion form starts from user goals and outcomes, and the contributor/maintainer docs plus PR template now describe the Discussion → Issue → PR graduation path (#1204).
- Release image gate gained a `probe` scenario (`make release-test` runs it as part of `all`): container-level checks that a Python test suite can't cover because they depend on the shipped image's process supervision — `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_WORKER_MAX_TASKS` reaching the in-image worker (the supervisord `sh -c` expansion), and the worker surviving startup with `HTTP_PROXY` set while a user's `NO_PROXY` value is preserved (the internal SurrealDB websocket not being tunneled). Both were manual probes during the v1.14.0 release; they now run automatically. Release-process docs gained the post-tag re-cut sequence and a note on never leaving the version bump uncommitted (v1.14.0 retro)

## [1.14.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- **Docling formula & vision enrichment toggles** in Settings → Content Processing. Two new opt-in checkboxes surface content-core 2.x's `docling_formulas` (extract mathematical formulas as structured markup) and `docling_vision` (describe images and extract chart data with a vision model) enrichment flags, mirroring the existing OCR toggle. Both default off; the vision help text warns it is significantly slower and may call a vision model. Like OCR, the toggles only take effect through the Docling engine, so they are gated on Docling availability. The settings persist via `GET`/`PUT /api/settings` and are threaded into content-core extraction alongside `docling_ocr` (migration 23 backfills the new fields); labels and help are translated across all 14 locales (#1131)
- **OpenRouter now supports text-to-speech and speech-to-text**, not just LLMs and embeddings (esperanto 2.25.0). The provider's modalities were extended so the Settings UI offers TTS/STT when registering OpenRouter models. Because OpenRouter's `/models` listing does not reliably tag audio models, discovery seeds the working defaults esperanto ships — `microsoft/mai-voice-2` (TTS) and `openai/whisper-1` + `openai/whisper-large-v3` (STT) — alongside the API-discovered language models; any other `vendor/model` id can be added manually. Note that `microsoft/mai-voice-2` uses Microsoft neural voice names (e.g. `en-US-AvaNeural`), not OpenAI's `alloy`/`nova` set (#987)
- Newer ElevenLabs models are now offered in model discovery: `eleven_v3`, `eleven_flash_v2_5` and `eleven_flash_v2` for text-to-speech, and `scribe_v2` for speech-to-text — alongside the existing models. Esperanto passes the `model_id` straight through to ElevenLabs, so no provider changes were needed (#1167)
- **`anthropic_compatible` credential provider**, mirroring the existing `openai_compatible` one, so endpoints that only speak the Anthropic Messages format (e.g. Kimi) can be connected with a base URL plus API key — from Settings → API Keys or via `ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` / `ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY`. The connection test carries one Anthropic-specific wrinkle: a 404/405 from `GET /models` is reported as "listing unsupported, register models manually" rather than a failed connection, since Messages-only endpoints are legitimately unable to list. Model discovery uses `GET /v1/models` with the Anthropic headers and shares the base-URL normalization and request-time re-validation used by provisioning. Provider card and credential form translated across all 14 locales (#675)
- **First-class oMLX provider** in Settings → API Keys: native Esperanto `omlx` profile identity (language + embedding), default base URL `http://localhost:11435/v1` (avoids SurrealDB on 8000), optional API key, connection test and `/v1/models` discovery. No remapping to `openai-compatible` and no `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_*` env mirroring. Docs under `docs/5-CONFIGURATION/omlx.md` (#1048; upstream lfnovo/esperanto#228)
- **Four new AI providers** (surfaced by esperanto 2.25.1) are now in the provider matrix. **Cohere** (`COHERE_API_KEY`) adds language and embedding models via Cohere's native v2 API (`command-*` chat, `embed-*`); model discovery is bespoke (esperanto's `AIFactory.get_provider_models`) since Cohere is not OpenAI-compatible, and Cohere reranking is intentionally left out of scope (tracked at #1087). **PayPerQ / PPQ** (`PPQ_API_KEY`, `https://api.ppq.ai/v1`) is a multi-modality OpenAI-compatible gateway offering language, embedding, speech-to-text and text-to-speech. **Novita** (`NOVITA_API_KEY`, `https://api.novita.ai/openai`) is an OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway. PPQ and Novita auto-discover their models through the standard `/models` endpoint. In addition, the existing **Deepgram** provider now also supports **speech-to-text** (Nova/Whisper transcription models, e.g. `nova-3`) alongside its Aura text-to-speech voices. All four are configured from Settings → Models exactly like the existing providers (#1170)
- **Worker concurrency is now configurable** via `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_WORKER_MAX_TASKS`. The surreal-commands worker always ran with a hardcoded concurrency of 5, which overloads single-GPU and local-LLM setups and trips provider rate limits when several sources are processed at once. The variable is wired into every launch point — `make worker-start`/`make start-all`, `dev-init.sh`, and the Docker `supervisord.conf` (wrapped in `sh -c` so the shell actually expands it, since `command=` does not run through a shell) — and defaults to 5; set it to 1 for strictly sequential processing. It is read at worker launch time, so changing it requires restarting the worker. This also removes a phantom entry from the docs: `SURREAL_COMMANDS_MAX_TASKS` was documented but read nowhere (the worker's `--max-tasks` Typer option has no envvar binding) and has been replaced with the real variable in `.env.example` and the environment reference (#893)
- Episode profiles now expose an optional **"Max output tokens"** field in the UI. The `max_tokens` value already existed on the podcast episode profile model but could only be set through the API; the profile form now offers it as a number input (positive integer, clearable to unset), mirroring how `num_segments` is handled — zod validation, form defaults/reset and submit payload — and the episode card shows the configured value in its details. The field carries help text explaining that it caps output tokens per generation step (the outline and the full transcript — not a per-turn or conversation limit) and that leaving it blank uses the built-in defaults (3000 for the outline, 5000 for the transcript), plus a placeholder to the same effect; clearing it no longer trips a spurious "must be a positive integer" error (an empty or transient number-input state now reads as unset). Label, help and placeholder translated across all 14 locales (#991)
- Local commits are now gated by the same checks as CI: a new `.pre-commit-config.yaml` runs ruff lint (with `--fix`), ruff format, mypy (through `uv run` so it matches CI exactly) and basic hygiene hooks (large files, merge conflict markers, YAML/TOML syntax, trailing whitespace, EOF newlines), with install/run/skip instructions in the development-setup docs (#940)
- The i18n locale parity test now also compares **interpolation placeholders**, not just keys. It previously only checked that every locale defined the same key set, so a value carrying a stray single-brace `{count}` instead of i18next's `{{count}}` — or a placeholder that does not exist in the en-US reference — passed silently and rendered as literal text at runtime. Every leaf string is now checked against en-US for both missing/extra `{{...}}` placeholders and stray single-brace tokens; this caught and fixed `podcasts.generationStartedDesc` in zh-CN and zh-TW, which referenced a `{{name}}` placeholder the reference string does not have (#1159)
- The dev Docker build (`build-regular`) is gated on image-affecting paths, so docs- and config-only PRs no longer wait several minutes for a byte-identical image. A `paths-filter` job decides whether the build steps run; the job itself always executes so the required status check always reports — deliberately avoiding the workflow-level paths filter that would leave the required check permanently pending and deadlock merges. PRs touching the Dockerfile, dependencies, app or frontend build as before, and the release build is untouched (#1134)
- Release tooling: `rc-stack.sh up` now `docker pull`s `lfnovo/open_notebook:<tag>` before booting so a same-named local build cannot shadow the registry artifact during release verification (non-fatal for local-only tags), and a new `--with-runtimes` flag enables the opt-in Docling/Crawl4AI heavy engines on the RC stack so the published image's opt-in install path can be exercised with real data. Both gotchas are documented in `RELEASE_PROCESS.md`; the default release-test compose leaves the runtimes off to keep fresh/upgrade runs fast (#1133)
- README now links to [@lfnovo on X](https://x.com/lfnovo) for project updates (#1158)

### Changed
- Bumped the esperanto floor to `>=2.25.1`. This is the dependency change that unlocks the oMLX provider, the Cohere/Deepgram STT/PPQ/Novita providers, OpenRouter TTS/STT, Vertex service-account auth and the native Anthropic `to_langchain()` base URL forwarding listed elsewhere in this release. A clean drop-in — no application code changes were required (#1176)
- Removed the `ChatAnthropic` re-injection shim used by `anthropic_compatible` models. esperanto 2.25.1 forwards a custom `base_url` natively through `to_langchain()`, so the `_to_langchain()` helper in `provision.py` and the `_open_notebook_provider` marker it depended on (its only consumer) are gone; provisioning now calls `model.to_langchain()` directly. No behavior change — custom Anthropic-compatible endpoints keep working, now through the upstream path (#1055)
- Japanese (ja-JP) translations reviewed and improved throughout: "トランスフォーメーション" replaced with the natural 変換, duration formatting given proper spacing, and accessibility labels, error messages and assorted phrasings rewritten to read naturally rather than as literal translations (#998)

### Fixed
- **A content-processing engine whose runtime is not installed no longer breaks ingestion silently.** The engine choice is persisted in the database, but the opt-in runtimes that serve it (Docling, local Crawl4AI) are installed from environment flags evaluated at boot — so a redeploy that drops `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENABLE_CRAWL4AI`/`_DOCLING`, a data volume moved to a new deployment, or a failed on-demand install leaves a stored selection pointing at a runtime that is absent. That selection was passed straight to content-core, and every affected extraction failed with "Could not extract any text content from this source" — naming neither the engine, the runtime, nor the flag that would fix it; with the URL engine set to Crawl4AI it broke URL ingestion entirely. The source graph now checks runtime availability first and degrades to content-core's `auto` chain, logging a warning that names the engine and the variable that would enable it; engines needing no opt-in runtime (`auto`/`simple`/`firecrawl`/`jina`) are untouched. The availability probes moved to `open_notebook/utils/runtime_capabilities.py` so the graph can share them with `GET /api/capabilities`, whose behavior is unchanged (#1194)
- **HTTP proxy no longer breaks worker/API startup.** `websockets` 15.0 began auto-detecting `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` and tunnels even `ws://` connections through the proxy, so with a proxy set the internal SurrealDB websocket (`ws://host.docker.internal:8018/rpc` or `ws://surrealdb:8000/rpc`) was routed through the external proxy, which rejected the internal host with HTTP 403 and killed the worker on startup. Open Notebook now injects `host.docker.internal,surrealdb,localhost,127.0.0.1` into `no_proxy`/`NO_PROXY` at startup (merged with any user value, never clobbering it), and the `.env.example` / docs `NO_PROXY` examples now include the internal DB hosts (#1160)
- Auto-assign no longer silently re-populates optional model defaults that were deliberately cleared. Previously `POST /models/auto-assign` treated every empty slot as "missing" and filled it, so an optional slot a user intentionally cleared (to fall back to the chat model) got re-assigned on the next run. Auto-assign now fills only the two required slots (chat, embedding); the optional slots (transformation, tools, large context, TTS, STT) are left untouched. `large_context` now also falls back to the chat model when unset (matching transformation/tools) instead of returning nothing, and the Settings UI shows an inline hint on each empty optional slot — "using chat model (…)" for the text slots, "not configured" for TTS/STT (#1098)
- PPQ model discovery now lists all modalities, not just chat. PPQ's `/v1/models` returns only chat/language models by default; the discovery URL now requests `?type=all` so the embedding, speech-to-text and text-to-speech models this multi-modality gateway advertises actually surface in the provider matrix (`PPQ_MODEL_TYPES` classifies them into the right slots) (#1180)
- Vertex credentials now configure text-to-speech (and other Vertex providers) correctly when used through a stored credential rather than environment variables. `Credential.to_esperanto_config()` emitted the generic `project`/`location` keys, but esperanto's Vertex providers expect `vertex_project`/`vertex_location` — so credential-linked Vertex TTS crashed with `__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'project'`. The config now maps to the Vertex-specific key names for the `vertex` provider only; the `Credential` schema/API fields stay `project`/`location`, and non-Vertex providers are unaffected (#1151)
- Deleting a notebook now also deletes its chat sessions instead of leaving orphaned `chat_session` records behind. The notebook `delete()` cascade enumerates the notebook's chat sessions (via the existing `refers_to` relation) and deletes each one alongside the notes and exclusive sources it already handled (#1124)
- **Outbound requests to user-supplied provider endpoints are now pinned to a DNS-vetted IP address.** Validating a URL and then handing it to httpx left a DNS-rebinding TOCTOU window: httpx re-resolves the hostname at connect time, so a hostname that passed validation could resolve to a link-local or cloud metadata address (e.g. `169.254.169.254`, `fd00:ec2::254`) on the actual connection. A new `prepare_pinned_http_target()` helper resolves once, rejects dangerous addresses, and rewrites the request URL to the vetted IP while preserving the original hostname in the `Host` header and TLS SNI (IDNA-encoded), so routing and certificate verification are unaffected. Applied consistently to the credential-save, connection-test and model-discovery paths for `openai_compatible`, `ollama`, `azure` and the OpenAI provider's custom `base_url` (#1063)
- Per-transformation model selection now actually takes effect. A transformation's assigned `model_id` was persisted but ignored at execution time: both call sites that run the transformation graph (the source-processing graph and the `run_transformation` background command) invoked it without a config, so the graph node always read a `None` model and fell back to the global default transformation model. Both now forward `transformation.model_id` through the LangGraph `configurable` config, so a transformation configured to use a specific model runs on that model (an unset `model_id` still falls back to the default) (#1137)
- Error text surfaced by the sources API is now capped at 200 characters. `GET` source status and synchronous processing failures returned the raw command/result `error_message` unbounded, which could push arbitrary internal exception text (including stack detail from third-party extraction libraries) to clients and did not match the truncation already applied elsewhere in the API. Both paths now go through a `None`-safe truncation helper that appends an ellipsis when it cuts (#1136)
- **Typing in the chat composer no longer lags in long conversations**, which was especially painful for IME users (Japanese, Chinese, Korean) whose per-keystroke composition events made the whole message history re-render. The composer input state moved into a dedicated `ChatComposer` child so keystrokes stay local to it, each message row is memoized with `React.memo`, and the reference-click handler is stabilized with `useCallback` — which in turn required memoizing `openModal`/`closeModal` in `useModalManager`, since their changing identities were re-rendering every memoized row on each composer keystroke. Send behavior and the Ctrl/Cmd+Enter shortcut are unchanged (#1147)
- The quick-start guide and the two Ollama compose examples set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, which no code path reads — the variable the provider registry actually looks for is `OLLAMA_API_BASE`. Following the examples verbatim left Ollama permanently unavailable with no error to explain why. All three shipped files now use the correct name (#1148)

## [1.13.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Opt-in heavy extraction runtimes.** Docling (layout parsing + OCR + image sources) and local Crawl4AI (JavaScript rendering) are now **opt-in**, installed automatically on first container startup when enabled — instead of being bundled into (or missing from) every image. Set `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENABLE_DOCLING=true` and/or `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENABLE_CRAWL4AI=true`; the downloads are cached on the `/app/data` volume so only the first boot is slow, and a failed install degrades gracefully (the app still starts, the engine is reported unavailable) with loud logs. A new `GET /api/capabilities` probe reports what's actually installed, and Settings → Content Processing disables the Docling engine, the Crawl4AI engine and the OCR toggle (with an env-var hint) until their runtime is available — so the UI never advertises an engine that isn't there. This keeps the default image lean (no Chromium, no multi-GB ML stack) while making both runtimes available on demand. A remote Crawl4AI server via `CRAWL4AI_API_URL` needs no local install. New hint strings added across all 14 locales; recorded as ADR-007 (#1122)
- **OCR toggle** in Settings → Content Processing: a new "Enable OCR" checkbox controls whether the Docling engine runs OCR on scanned PDFs and images. It's on by default (matching content-core's behavior); turn it off to speed up processing of text-native documents. The setting is passed to content-core's `docling_ocr` config, and the label/help are translated across all 14 locales. OCR only runs through Docling, so the toggle takes effect once Docling is enabled (see #1122) (#1104)
- **Crawl4AI** is now selectable as a URL processing engine in Settings → Content Processing, alongside Firecrawl, Jina and Simple. It renders JavaScript-heavy pages locally with no API key, or offloads to a Crawl4AI server when `CRAWL4AI_API_URL` is set. Local Crawl4AI (and its Chromium browser) is an opt-in runtime installed on first startup when `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENABLE_CRAWL4AI=true` (see #1122) — the default image stays lean. As part of this, the persisted document/URL engine choices now actually take effect: the source-processing graph reads the saved Content Settings and passes them to content-core (previously it always ran with hard-coded `auto` engines and silently ignored the selection). New engine label added across all 14 locales (#432)
- Source extraction now logs the **effective content-core engine** at INFO (`url_engine` / `document_engine` / `docling_ocr`) right before it runs. content-core only logs its own engine dispatch at DEBUG, so operators previously had no way to confirm which engine actually processed a source — e.g. whether a persisted Crawl4AI/Docling selection took effect or the request silently fell back to the `auto` chain (#1125)

### Changed
- Upgraded the content extraction dependency from content-core 1.14.x to 2.x (2.0.4). The source-processing graph was adapted to content-core's new keyword-only `extract_content()` API: engine/model overrides now travel through a `ContentCoreConfig` object instead of the input dict, and the extraction result (`ExtractionOutput`) no longer echoes the source `url`/`file_path` back, so those are carried from the request state into the saved source asset. Because content-core 2.x no longer deletes the uploaded file after extraction, the graph now honors the `delete_source` flag itself. Transitively this replaces the AGPL-licensed PyMuPDF with MIT-licensed pdfplumber for PDF extraction and drops moviepy in favor of direct ffmpeg calls (which fixes audio extraction from MP3 files carrying chapter metadata). No user-facing configuration changes in this step — document and URL engines stay on their `auto` defaults; new engine/OCR options are tracked separately under #939 (#1103)
- Podcast episode audio paths are now stored relative to the podcasts folder (`episodes/<uuid>/audio/<name>.mp3`) instead of as absolute filesystem paths, validated at write time so the database can never hold an absolute or root-escaping value, and resolved + containment-checked through a single shared helper instead of per-endpoint guards. Migration 21 converts existing rows written under the known roots (plain `file:///` URIs, `/app/data/podcasts/`, `/data/podcasts/`, `./data/podcasts/`, `data/podcasts/`); previously generated episodes now survive a `DATA_FOLDER` relocation. Rows under any other root (e.g. a source checkout at a custom absolute path) or in exotic legacy forms (percent-encoded or host-qualified `file://` URIs) are left untouched and treated as legacy-invalid — the same 403/audio-unavailable handling out-of-root rows already had; regenerate the episode to restore playback. Podcast jobs whose audio combination fails (podcast-creator reports an in-band `ERROR:` value) now fail with the real ffmpeg/clip error instead of reporting success for an episode with no playable audio (#1030)
- The source detail view (dialog and full page) now fetches through the shared `useSource` React Query hook instead of a hand-rolled fetch, matching the insight/note dialogs: caching and the never-retry-404 policy come from React Query, title edits and deletes go through the shared mutation hooks (so source lists refresh and a deleted source can't be served from the cache), and the `key={sourceId}` remount workaround on the parents was removed — the component resets its own per-source UI state (#1106)
- The settings frontend now fetches the provider list from `GET /api/providers` (cached for the session) instead of keeping its own hardcoded provider tables, so adding a provider to the backend registry needs zero frontend edits: unknown modalities render with a fallback icon, the backend registry owns the display order, and the regex-based frontend/backend sync test was removed along with the duplicated tables in `frontend/src/lib/providers.tsx` (#1082)

### Removed
- The legacy provider/model string fields on podcast profiles (`outline_provider`, `outline_model`, `transcript_provider`, `transcript_model` on episode profiles; `tts_provider`, `tts_model` on speaker profiles) are gone from the database, the API and the UI — the app has ignored them since the Model registry references landed in v1.11. Migration 22 first best-effort maps any profile whose `outline_llm`/`transcript_llm`/`voice_model` reference is still empty to an existing model record (matching provider + name + type; no auto-creation, since a migration must not touch credentials), then drops the six columns; the startup data migration that used to retry this mapping on every boot (`open_notebook/podcasts/migration.py`) was deleted. Accepted trade-off: profiles whose mapping never converged (e.g. the provider credential was never configured) lose the legacy strings and stay unresolved — they were already non-functional and the UI already flags them as needing model selection, so you just re-pick the models in the profile form once (#1107)

### Fixed
- Uploading a file content-core can't extract now fails immediately at ingestion with a clear `415 Unsupported Media Type` error that names the detected MIME type, instead of enqueueing a background job that retried up to 15 times over ~1 hour before surfacing a generic "Failed" with no actionable detail. The pre-flight uses content-core 2.x's header-only `check_file_support()` — the same routing real extraction uses, so the verdict can't disagree with what would happen downstream — and the source-retry endpoint is guarded the same way; unexpected check errors (e.g. a file removed before a retry) fall through to normal extraction rather than becoming a hard rejection (#975)
- Podcast episode cards no longer show "— / —" for the outline, transcript and speaker model rows on new episodes: the API now resolves the snapshot's model references (`outline_llm`/`transcript_llm`/`voice_model`) to provider/name display fields at serialization time — batched into a single query per request, so listing episodes never does a per-row model lookup — and the card falls back to the legacy snapshot strings for old episodes and degrades to "—" when a referenced model was deleted (#1114)
- Renaming a speaker profile no longer breaks the episode profiles that use it: `episode_profile.speaker_config` now stores a `record<speaker_profile>` reference instead of the profile name (migration 20 converts existing rows; references whose speaker profile no longer exists at migration time become null, and any reference that later stops resolving is treated as "needs setup" — the UI asks you to pick a speaker again). The `POST /api/podcasts/generate` contract is unchanged — it still accepts the speaker profile by name and resolves it at the API boundary (#630)
- Clicking a chat/Ask citation that points at a deleted source, insight, or note now shows a shared, friendly "this content no longer exists" state in all three dialogs (instead of a raw error, a blank dialog, or an empty editable note editor), 404 lookups are no longer retried, and non-404 failures show a distinct "unable to load" message (#455)
- Source insights now get `created`/`updated` timestamps stamped at creation (migration 19 mirrors the defaults used by the other tables), and the insights API returns `null` — instead of the literal string `"None"` — for legacy insights that predate the migration (#1045)
- `uv sync` alone now provides the full dev toolchain: the legacy `[project.optional-dependencies].dev` list was merged into `[dependency-groups].dev` (mypy included — the documented `uv run python -m mypy .` previously failed on a fresh clone), Jupyter-only packages moved to a separate `notebooks` group, and the CI typecheck job no longer needs `--extra dev` (#1101)
- Optional model defaults (transformation, tools, large context, TTS, STT) can now be cleared: `PUT /api/models/defaults` honors explicit `null` (field absent still means "keep"; chat and embedding defaults reject `null`), and the default-model selects offer a "None" / "Use fallback (chat default)" option for the optional defaults (#1091)
- `docker-compose.yml` now uses the YAML list (exec) form for the SurrealDB `command`, so `SURREAL_USER` / `SURREAL_PASSWORD` values containing spaces are passed as single arguments instead of being split; the mirrored snippets in the installation docs and README (which had drifted — no credential interpolation, SurrealDB port published on all interfaces) are back in sync with the shipped file (#1093)
- zh-CN and zh-TW podcast toast descriptions (speaker/episode profile created/updated/deleted/duplicated) now include the profile name via the `{{name}}` placeholder, matching the other 12 locales (#1084)
- Docker images now force the Next.js frontend to bind to `0.0.0.0` in the supervisord command itself, so container runtimes that inject `HOSTNAME` (e.g. Podman pods, where it resolves to `127.0.1.1`) can no longer make the UI unreachable. The `HOSTNAME` variable is no longer honored as a frontend bind override — set the new `FRONTEND_BIND_HOST` variable instead (#994)
- Podcast generation now honors an explicitly supplied `speaker_profile` all the way into `generate_podcast_command`. The v1.12 fix stopped at the API boundary — the command still re-derived the speaker from the episode profile's `speaker_config` and silently dropped the override, so a direct caller's valid profile was ignored and generation failed when the episode profile pointed at a renamed/deleted speaker. The command now resolves `speaker_profile or episode_profile.speaker_config`, and the persisted episode plus the retry path reflect the actually-resolved profile (#1058)
- Creating a transformation from the empty state works again: after deleting every transformation, the empty-state "New Transformation" button did nothing because the editor dialog was only mounted in the non-empty branch. The dialog is now rendered in both branches so the create flow works with zero existing transformations (#999)

## [1.12.0] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Setup snippets no longer teach publishing SurrealDB on `0.0.0.0` — the compose and `docker run` examples across the README, quick starts, installation, configuration and development docs, and the `examples/docker-compose-*.yml` files now bind port 8000 to `127.0.0.1` (matching the shipped `docker-compose.yml`), with docs pointing to `docker-compose.override.yml.example` for opt-in remote access behind a firewall or SSH tunnel; the override example itself gained the `!override` tag it needs to actually replace the base port binding instead of colliding with it (#1034)

### Added
- Docs: cubic platform mechanics recorded as comments in `cubic.yaml` (agent limits, config precedence, memory/learning) and a "Merging PR Batches" playbook added to the maintainer guide (squash policy, CHANGELOG conflict resolution, fork rebases, competing-PR checks) (#1086)
- New `GET /api/providers` endpoint returning provider metadata from the registry (name, display name, modalities, docs URL, whether it is configured via environment variables), so clients can enumerate supported providers instead of hardcoding them (#1075)
- Release confidence process, documented and executable: `.github/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` now covers the risk-based test matrix (buckets A/B/C), the Docker image gate, the fix-loop re-test policy and the communication/credits/retro structure, backed by a new decision record (ADR-005) and versioned tooling under `scripts/release-test/` — `make release-test TAG= OLD_TAG=` runs fresh-install + upgrade scenarios against real images, and `make release-stack TAG= [DUMP=]` boots a browsable, isolated release-candidate stack (optionally with a copy of dev data) for manual verification (#1052)
- CI now gates every PR on `ruff check` (backend lint), `npm run lint` (frontend ESLint) and `npm run build` (frontend production build), in addition to the existing test suites (#1068)
- CI now also gates every PR on `mypy` (backend typecheck): the repo-wide baseline went from 197 errors to 0 (enabling the pydantic mypy plugin resolved most of them; the rest got real annotations), so new type errors are blocked from here on. The `ignore_errors` burn-down also started: `open_notebook.graphs.transformation`, `open_notebook.graphs.ask` and `api.routers.models` are now type-checked (plus two stale entries for deleted modules removed); only `open_notebook.domain.notebook` remains exempt pending the surreal-basics migration (#1076)

### Changed
- cubic AI review now skips `CHANGELOG.md`, `uv.lock` and `frontend/package-lock.json` (no reviewable logic; preserves the monthly reviewed-line quota) (#1080)
- Context building consolidated into a single implementation (`open_notebook/utils/context_builder.py`): the copy-pasted source/note assembly loops behind `POST /api/chat/context` and the removed notebook-context endpoint, plus the 495-line generalized `ContextBuilder` class (whose only caller was the source-chat graph), are now two focused functions — `build_notebook_context()` (backs `POST /api/chat/context`, unchanged request/response shapes and config semantics) and `build_source_context()` (backs the source-chat graph, same context shape and 50k-token budget). Pinned by new characterization tests — no behavior change for the surviving paths (#1079)
- **Removed** `POST /api/notebooks/{notebook_id}/context`: it duplicated `POST /api/chat/context` (same assembly logic, slightly different response envelope) and had zero callers — frontend, docs and tests only use `/api/chat/context`. If you called it programmatically, switch to `POST /api/chat/context` (body: `{notebook_id, context_config}`; response fields: `context.sources`/`context.notes`, `token_count`, `char_count`) (#1079)
- Backend provider metadata now lives in a single registry (`open_notebook/ai/provider_registry.py`): env var config, modalities, connection-test models, OpenAI-compatible discovery URLs and docs links are defined once per provider, and `PROVIDER_ENV_CONFIG`, `PROVIDER_MODALITIES`, `TEST_MODELS` and `OPENAI_COMPAT_PROVIDERS` are derived from it. Adding a provider drops from ~6 hand-synced dicts to the registry plus two manual copies (the `SupportedProvider` Literal and the frontend provider table), both enforced by tests (#1075)
- Frontend convention cleanup (no user-facing change): hook files unified to kebab-case (`useNotebookChat.ts`/`useSourceChat.ts` → `use-notebook-chat.ts`/`use-source-chat.ts`), `src/components/source/` merged into `src/components/sources/`, the localStorage auth-token parsing ritual extracted into a single `getAuthToken()` helper (`src/lib/auth-token.ts`), and non-streaming raw `fetch` calls routed through `apiClient` (podcast audio download, auth-status check). SSE/streaming paths and the login/checkAuth credential probes deliberately keep raw `fetch` (#1077)
- Pruned unused langchain packages: removed `langchain-community` and `langchain-deepseek` from the dependencies (nothing imports them — DeepSeek and xAI route through esperanto's OpenAI-compatible path, which uses `langchain-openai`). The remaining `langchain-*` provider packages are documented as runtime requirements of esperanto's dynamic `to_langchain()` and the whole langchain/langgraph family now carries explicit upper bounds; `langchain-core` and `langchain-text-splitters` (both directly imported but previously only transitive) are now declared explicitly (#1073)
- The two Docker images (regular and single-container) are now built from a single multi-stage `Dockerfile` with shared stages — regular is the default (`runtime`) target, single-container is `--target single` — so deploy fixes (tiktoken pre-cache, env defaults, npm retry logic) no longer have to be applied twice. `Dockerfile.single` and `supervisord.single.conf` were removed; the single image appends a small `supervisord.surrealdb.conf` to the shared `supervisord.conf` at build time. Published image names and tags are unchanged (#1066)
- Model discovery is now table-driven: the eight providers with OpenAI-compatible `/models` endpoints (OpenAI, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI, OpenRouter, DashScope, MiniMax) share one generic discovery function configured by `OPENAI_COMPAT_PROVIDERS`, replacing eight near-identical copies (provider-specific quirks like Mistral's capability flags and OpenRouter's descriptions are preserved as hooks) (#1070)
- Internal refactor: extracted the session/source verification, record-ID normalization, LangGraph message extraction and shared response models duplicated across the chat and source-chat routers into `api/routers/_chat_shared.py`, pinned by new characterization tests — no behavior change (#1072)
- Internal refactor of the sources API router: extracted a shared `SourceResponse` builder (was hand-rolled 5×), a single upload-cleanup helper (was pasted 6×), split the 293-line create-source endpoint into validation + sync/async path functions, and unified the duplicated paginated list query. No behavior change; all security checks (atomic filename claim, path-traversal containment, SSRF/LFI guards) preserved verbatim (#1069)
- Re-enabled the ruff rules for unused imports (`F401`), unused local variables (`F841`) and bare `except:` (`E722`) that were ignored to silence legacy Streamlit-era noise, and cleaned up the remaining fallout (10 unused imports, 2 unused test variables; no bare excepts remained) (#1062)
- Internal refactor with no user-facing change: split the 1,441-line API Keys settings page into focused components under `frontend/src/components/settings/` and moved the provider config tables to `frontend/src/lib/providers.tsx`, deduplicating the default-model select in the process (#1065)
- Chat, source chat, Ask and transformation prompts now steer models to write math as `$$...$$` (display) / `$...$` (inline) so formulas render via KaTeX, reserving fenced `latex` code blocks for when the user explicitly asks for the LaTeX source (#1051)
- Frontend locale files are now type-checked at compile time: every non-en-US locale declares `satisfies TranslationShape` (derived from the en-US object), so a missing or extra i18n key fails `tsc` in the editor instead of only the runtime parity test. Also removed two unused frontend dependencies (`next-themes`, `@monaco-editor/react`) and fixed `frontend/AGENTS.md` drift (14 locales, not 7; dark mode is the hand-rolled zustand theme-store, not next-themes) (#1061)

### Fixed
- Eight podcast toast descriptions (speaker/episode profile created/updated/deleted/duplicated) showed the literal `{name}` placeholder instead of the profile name: the locale strings used single braces (which i18next ignores) and the `t()` call sites passed no values. Placeholders normalized to `{{name}}` across all locales and the actual name is now passed in from the mutation response/variables (#1077)
- Typed domain errors now return their documented HTTP status codes instead of a generic 500: the API routers used to wrap endpoint bodies in a broad `except Exception` that swallowed the `open_notebook.exceptions` hierarchy before the global handlers could map it (`NotFoundError`→404, `InvalidInputError`→400, `ConfigurationError`→422, `RateLimitError`→429, `NetworkError`/`ExternalServiceError`→502). All 18 affected routers now re-raise `HTTPException` and `OpenNotebookError` and only convert genuinely unexpected exceptions into sanitized 500s. Most visible changes: a missing/unconfigured model (`ConfigurationError`) now returns 422 with an actionable message instead of 500; getting or deleting a source-chat session whose session isn't related to the source returns 404 (was a 500 wrapping the inner 404); fetching a missing credential returns 404 (was 500) (#1078)
- Frontend translations now use i18next interpolation (`t('key', { count })`) instead of manual `.replace('{count}', ...)` string surgery across ~75 call sites — locale placeholders changed from `{name}` to `{{name}}` in all 14 locales. This restores proper pluralization (e.g. "used by N episodes" now goes through i18next plural forms) and lets translators reorder placeholders freely (#1074)
- Podcast generation dialog: the token/char counter no longer fires a request storm on rapid checkbox toggling (debounced, with a stale-response guard so a slow response can't overwrite a fresher count) and the dialog now closes as soon as the episode-list refetch completes instead of after a fixed 500ms timer; the 983-line component was also split (content selection panel and selection helpers extracted, duplicated context-config logic deduplicated) with no behavior changes (#1067)
- Anthropic models are now discovered live from `GET https://api.anthropic.com/v1/models` (paginated) instead of a hardcoded claude-3-era list — the code comment claiming "Anthropic doesn't have a model listing API" was wrong. A refreshed static list (current Claude 4.x/5 aliases) remains as a fallback when the API call fails, and the credential-based discovery path (`discover_with_config`) uses the same live-with-fallback logic (#1070)
- Deduplicated the embedding commands (`commands/embedding_commands.py`, ~100 lines less): `embed_note`/`embed_insight`/`embed_source` now share one load→embed→write core with a single error-handling epilogue, the rebuild command uses one submission-loop helper for all three kinds, and the thrice-copied `full_model_dump()` moved to `open_notebook/utils/model_utils.py`. Pure refactor — same outputs, logs and retry behavior (#1071)

### Removed
- Dead Streamlit-era service layer (~2,000 lines): `api/client.py` (a synchronous HTTP client that called the app's own API) and 13 `api/*_service.py` wrappers that consumed the app's own HTTP API — none were imported by any router, command or test. Also removed the toy `process_text`/`analyze_data` demo commands (`commands/example_commands.py`) from the background worker (#1054)
- Pre-1.6 embedding job compatibility shims (the `embed_single_item`, `embed_chunk` and `vectorize_source` command handlers) — they existed only so jobs queued by a pre-1.6 version could drain after an upgrade, and any worker restarted on 1.6+ has no such jobs. **Upgrade note:** if you are upgrading from a version older than 1.6 with embedding jobs still queued, drain the queue on a 1.x release before upgrading past this change. Also removed dead tooling config from `pyproject.toml`: the `[tool.mypy]` block (the real config is `mypy.ini`) and Streamlit-era ruff per-file-ignores for files that no longer exist (#1056)
- Committed QA screenshots (12 files) and a stray debug `history.txt` were removed from the repo root, with `.gitignore` rules added so they can't come back (#1053)

### Fixed
- Podcast generation now honors the `speaker_profile` parameter of `POST /api/podcasts/generate` — previously it was silently ignored and the speaker was always re-derived from the episode profile's `speaker_config`, which failed when that pointed at a renamed/deleted speaker profile even if the caller supplied a valid one (#1044)

## [1.11.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- `VISION.md` — the product's source of truth in two layers: durable identity (what Open Notebook is and is not, core principles) and current posture (the phase we're in, directional constraints, and the horizon clusters under consideration)
- Decision records at `docs/7-DEVELOPMENT/decisions/` — short, immutable ADRs/PDRs answering "why is it like this?", seeded with 4 retroactive ADRs (SurrealDB, delegation to external libraries, Streamlit→Next.js, background workers) and 2 PDRs (single-user first, provider-agnostic core)
- `AGENTS.md` files (root, `open_notebook/`, `frontend/`) with the normative rules for coding agents and humans — commands, hard rules, and gotchas not derivable from the code; `CLAUDE.md` files are now one-line pointers to them
- Five new engineering docs pages under `docs/7-DEVELOPMENT/`: credentials, content processing, podcasts, prompts, and frontend architecture
- Contribution guidelines for AI-assisted and agent-generated PRs in the contributing guide — the operator owns the PR, issue-first still applies, tests must have actually run
- CI check for broken relative links in markdown (`scripts/check_md_links.py` + `docs-links` workflow on PRs touching `*.md`)
- `cubic.yaml` — AI review settings as code: PR-contract instructions, three custom review agents (vision & principles alignment backed by `VISION.md`, known mechanical caveats, security & testability) and automatic ultrareviews for auth/credential/encryption/migration changes
- Documented the flow-driven release process in `.github/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`, including the `ready` to `main` to stable release path, dev/stable image labels, and maintainer verification checklist (#938)
- List view for the Notebooks page — a tile/list toggle in the header lets you switch between the visual card grid and a compact row layout (name, description, source/note counts, last updated) for easier scanning of large collections. The choice is remembered across reloads and translated across all 14 locales (#885)
- Documented the `ESPERANTO_TTS_TIMEOUT` environment variable (default `300`s) in the environment reference; raise it for slow or self-hosted TTS providers so long podcast segments don't fail with a timeout (#937)
- `SECURITY.md` with a coordinated-disclosure policy: how to privately report a vulnerability via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting, supported versions, and response expectations (#943)
- LaTeX math rendering (KaTeX) now also applies to source content, source insights, Ask answers, transformation output, and the note editor preview — previously only chat had it (#269)
- Syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks in chat responses, source content, insights and Ask/Search answers — light/dark aware, with 25 common languages bundled (others render as plain text) (#783)
- "Recently Viewed" section on the Notebooks page — a collapsible grid of the last 12 notebooks and sources you opened, newest first, hidden when there's no view history. Backed by a new `last_viewed_at` timestamp stamped on read and a `GET /api/recently-viewed` endpoint (translated across all 14 locales) (#850)
- Per-transformation model selection — each transformation can now be assigned its own language model from the transformation editor, overriding the global transformation default for that transformation only. Runs without an explicit model keep using the system default as before (#776)
- "Refresh content" action on web-link sources — re-fetches the URL and re-embeds the source so its content stays current, available from the source card menu once processing has completed (translated across all 14 locales) (#259)
- Sources table can now be sorted by every column — type, title, insights count, embedded status, created and updated (a new "Updated" column was added) — via clickable column headers backed by new `GET /api/sources` sort fields (translated across all locales) (#895)
- EasyPanel deployment template under `examples/easypanel/` — provisions the app plus a dedicated SurrealDB service with auto-generated database/encryption secrets — plus an EasyPanel section in the single-container install guide (#189)
- Test coverage measurement in CI: backend via `pytest-cov` (terminal + XML reports), frontend via `@vitest/coverage-v8` and a new `test:coverage` script (#942)

### Changed
- Developer documentation restructured: 17 knowledge-heavy `CLAUDE.md` files consolidated into the 3 `AGENTS.md` + docs pages above; `README.dev.md` became a pointer after its unique content moved into `development-setup.md` (make-workflow matrix), `.github/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` (Docker publishing) and the change playbooks (add-a-language); the maintainer guide now carries the curated label taxonomy (state funnel, `area:` labels, consolidation rules)
- Fixed stale developer docs while migrating: real migration path/format (`open_notebook/database/migrations/N.surrealql` + `AsyncMigrationManager` registration), provider count (17), locale list (7), and 9 README links that pointed at documentation pages that never existed
- The API's listen interface in the Docker images is now configurable via a new `API_HOST` environment variable instead of a hardcoded `--host 0.0.0.0`. The default is unchanged (`0.0.0.0`); set `API_HOST=::` to serve IPv6/dual-stack environments (#985)
- `docker-compose.yml` now sources the SurrealDB credentials from `SURREAL_USER` / `SURREAL_PASSWORD` (applied to both the database server and the app), defaulting to `root:root` so the zero-config quick start is unchanged. Set them in a `.env` file to use your own credentials before exposing the instance; `.env.example` and the compose file note this (#946)
- Docs no longer claim a hardcoded default API password (`open-notebook-change-me`) exists; the actual behavior is that auth is disabled entirely when `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD` is unset. Also removed the dead `check_api_password` helper that had been superseded by the auth middleware (#1026)

### Fixed
- Testing a valid Google/Vertex credential no longer fails after Google retires a Gemini model. The connection test used a hard-coded model id that Google shuts down on a schedule (`gemini-2.0-flash`), so a valid key surfaced as a broken connection (#970). The Google/Vertex test now uses Google's floating `gemini-flash-latest` alias, and the provider connection test was reframed so only a rejected key, missing permissions, or an unreachable endpoint count as failures — a missing/retired/rate-limited model still reports the credentials as valid. Deprecated `gemini-1.5`/`gemini-2.0` model references were also removed from the connection-test model lists and documentation
- API startup no longer crashes when SurrealDB isn't ready yet (e.g. docker-compose race on host reboot: `Temporary failure in name resolution`). The lifespan now polls a lightweight readiness probe with bounded exponential backoff (~50s budget, 5s per-probe timeout) before running migrations; migration errors themselves still fail fast (#708)
- Markdown typography styles (`prose` classes) are active again: the Tailwind v4 migration left the old `tailwind.config.ts` (which loaded `@tailwindcss/typography`) silently ignored, so rendered markdown lost its typographic styling. The plugin and class-based dark mode are now configured in `globals.css`, and markdown rendering is centralized in a shared `MarkdownRenderer` component (#783)
- Podcast generation no longer truncates on dense, long-form content (`LengthFinishReasonError` / `OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE`): episode profiles now support an optional `max_tokens` that is passed through to podcast_creator's outline/transcript generation, overriding its defaults — settable via the episode profile API (UI follow-up in #991) (#639)
- API no longer freezes for all requests while a chat waits on the LLM. Both the notebook chat (`execute_chat`) and source chat handlers ran LangGraph's synchronous `invoke()` directly on the event loop; they now run it via `asyncio.to_thread()` (matching the existing `get_state` calls), so other requests stay responsive — and the source-chat SSE can flush its early events instead of stalling until the model finishes (#704)
- Windows native install guide no longer points users at a `start-open-notebook.bat` that doesn't exist in the repo; the Quick Start now documents starting the four services manually with `uv run`, plus an optional sample launcher you can save yourself (#846)
- OpenRouter (and other providers') "Discover models" dialog no longer cuts off the submit button: the dialog now uses a fixed header/footer with a scrollable body (`grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto]`) instead of scrolling the whole content, so the "Add" button stays visible regardless of how many models are listed (#816)
- Chat references using the short `[insight:<id>]` form (emitted by some models) are now rendered as clickable citations like `[source_insight:<id>]` and `[note:<id>]` already were; `insight` is treated as an alias for `source_insight`, so clicking it opens the insight (#490)
- CRUD endpoints now return `404` (not `500`) for a non-existent resource. `ObjectModel.get()` raises `NotFoundError` rather than returning a falsy value, so the broad `except Exception` in each handler was masking it as a server error. Added an explicit `NotFoundError → 404` arm to the notebook (update / delete / delete-preview / add-source / remove-source), note (get / update / delete / list / create), model (delete), credential (update / delete) and embed handlers (#862)
- Token counting no longer raises `ValueError: disallowed special token '<|endoftext|>'` when source/context content contains special-token sequences; `token_count()` now encodes with `disallowed_special=()` so such substrings are treated as ordinary text (#667)
- Single-container image no longer hangs at "API not ready yet" on a brand-new instance. `supervisord.single.conf` ran the API and worker with `uv run` (without `--no-sync`), so at startup `uv` tried to sync dev dependencies it couldn't resolve against the `--no-dev` build. Both processes now use `uv run --no-sync`, matching the multi-container `supervisord.conf` (#609)
- Note editor now expands to fill the dialog instead of being capped at `500px`; removed the `max-h-[500px]` constraint that overrode the `flex-1` parent and cramped editing on tall windows (#932)
- Ask and source-chat responses now stream progressively instead of hanging at "Processing..." until the full answer is ready. The API's streaming endpoints now declare `text/event-stream` (with no-buffering headers), and dedicated Next.js route handlers pass the SSE body through as a stream — Next.js `rewrites()` buffers SSE responses to completion (#770)
- Chat, notebook-context and podcast generation now build their context with a single batched insight query instead of one query per source (14 → 3 queries on a 12-source notebook), via the new `SourceInsight.get_for_sources()` (#1008)
- File uploads no longer block the event loop: `save_uploaded_file()` now writes via `asyncio.to_thread()`, keeping the API responsive during large uploads (#1009)
- URL validation no longer blocks the event loop on DNS resolution: `validate_url()` is now async and resolves hostnames via `asyncio.to_thread()`, so a slow DNS lookup on the model-provisioning path can't stall concurrent requests (#1011)
- Creating a credential with an unknown provider name now fails with a clear `422` at the API boundary instead of an opaque error deep in the domain layer; `provider` is validated against the 17 supported providers, and a test keeps the frontend/backend provider lists in sync (#1016)
- Podcast episode listing now batch-fetches job statuses in one query instead of one per episode, speeding up notebooks with many episodes; podcast audio-file paths are additionally verified to stay within the podcasts folder before streaming/deleting (#1018)
- Transformations no longer report success while silently losing their insight when the embedding job fails to queue: `Source.add_insight()` now raises on submission failure (handled by job-level retry), note auto-embedding degrades gracefully instead of turning a note save into a 500, and the explicit note-embed endpoint surfaces queue failures as errors (#1019)
- Clearing a credential field in the edit dialog (Ollama/OpenAI-compatible `base_url`, Vertex `project`/`location`/`credentials_path`) now actually clears it. Two mirror-image bugs made it impossible: the frontend dropped emptied fields from the PUT body (`undefined` keys are stripped by `JSON.stringify`), and the API ignored explicit `null`s (`is not None` guards) — so the old value survived while the UI reported success. The frontend now sends explicit `null` and the API keys partial updates on field presence (`model_fields_set`) (#1046)

### Security
- Resolved dependency audit findings: added npm `overrides` for vulnerable transitive frontend packages (`ws`, `brace-expansion`, `ajv`, `@eslint/plugin-kit`, `postcss`) — `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities — refreshed `uv.lock` (`langsmith`, `pydantic-settings`, `pip`), and hardened external `window.open(..., '_blank')` calls with `noopener,noreferrer` (#962)
- SurrealQL injection via record ids in `repo_relate()`/`repo_upsert()`/`repo_update()`: a crafted `notebook_id` on the save-insight-as-note flow could execute arbitrary SurrealQL. Record identifiers are now bound as query parameters, and the target notebook's existence is validated before relating (#1002)
- The API password is now compared with `secrets.compare_digest()` instead of `!=`, closing a timing side-channel on authentication (#1003)
- User-authored transformation prompts are no longer compiled as Jinja2 template source (a DoS vector via template loops); they are passed as plain variables into fixed developer-authored templates, so Jinja syntax inside a prompt renders as inert text. Output is unchanged for legitimate prompts (#1004)
- SSRF protection on source-URL ingestion: adding a web-link source now runs the same `validate_url()` guard already used for credential URLs, rejecting internal/private/cloud-metadata addresses (#1005)
- Provider-credential URLs are re-validated immediately before every outbound request (connection tests, model discovery and inference) instead of only at save time, closing a DNS-rebinding window; AWS's IPv6 metadata address was added to the blocklist (#1006)
- The note/transformation markdown preview now sanitizes raw HTML via `rehype-sanitize`: `<iframe>`/`<script>`/`<style>` tags and `javascript:` URLs are stripped while math, syntax highlighting and GFM still render — closing an HTML-injection path via AI-generated note content (#1007)
- Vertex credential-test errors no longer reveal whether a `credentials_path` file is missing, invalid JSON or wrong-shape JSON (a filesystem oracle); all three cases now return one generic message (#1012)
- CORS no longer combines the wildcard origin with `allow_credentials=True` (which made Starlette reflect any Origin verbatim for credentialed requests); credentials are now only allowed when `CORS_ORIGINS` is explicitly configured (#1013)
- Request bodies are now capped before auth and routing by a new `MaxBodySizeMiddleware` — default 100 MB, configurable via the new `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` environment variable; chunked uploads are caught by a streaming byte-count (#1014)
- Source upload hardening: unique filenames are claimed atomically (closing a TOCTOU race between the exists-check and the write), path-containment checks require a trailing separator so sibling directories can't pass, and the `notebooks`/`transformations` arrays on source creation are capped at 50 items (#1015)
- API 500 responses from the sources and podcast endpoints no longer echo internal exception text (which could leak DB hostnames or connection details); responses use fixed generic messages and details remain in server logs (#1017)
- `Credential.get_all()` no longer builds its ORDER BY clause from a raw f-string; ordering fields now go through the base-class allowlist validation (not reachable from the current API surface — defense in depth) (#1021)
- The frontend runtime-config endpoint validates `Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` before using them to build the browser-facing API URL, preventing a spoofed Host header from redirecting browser API traffic (including the bearer token) to an attacker-controlled origin; malformed values fall back to localhost (#1024)
- `docker-compose.yml` now binds SurrealDB's published port to `127.0.0.1` instead of all interfaces, so the database (root:root by default) is no longer reachable from other machines out of the box; a new `docker-compose.override.yml.example` shows how to re-expose it deliberately (#1025)
- Forced **Pillow to 12.3.0**, resolving 6 open Dependabot advisories (3 high: PSD out-of-bounds writes, FITS GZIP decompression bomb; 3 moderate: PDF trailer DoS, font integer overflow, heap buffer overflow). The only blocker was moviepy's `pillow<12` cap (pulled in via podcast-creator) — moviepy only touches PIL in its video modules, which the audio-only podcast pipeline never imports, so a documented `[tool.uv] override-dependencies` entry forces the safe version until podcast-creator ships without moviepy (#1041)

## [1.10.0] - 2026-06-17

### Security
- Bumped **Starlette to 1.2.1** and **FastAPI to 0.136.3** to address **CVE-2026-48710** ("BadHost"), a denial-of-service in Starlette's host header handling (#859)

### Added
- LaTeX math rendering in chat — inline (`$...$`) and display (`$$...$$`) expressions are now rendered with KaTeX (#606)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable to configure the frontend API request timeout (default `600000` = 10 minutes; set `0` to disable). Lets slow/long-running chat models finish without editing source (#880)
- Bulk chat-context actions in a notebook, via a "Context" menu in the Sources and Notes column headers — translated across all 14 locales (#223):
  - Sources: "Include all (insights only)" (sources without insights are left out rather than forced to full), "Include all (full content)", and "Exclude all from context"
  - Notes: "Include all in context" / "Exclude all from context"
- **Turkish (tr-TR) localization** — the UI is now fully translated into Turkish (#871)

### Changed
- Failed source cards now show a prominent "Retry processing" button directly on the card instead of only inside the 3-dot dropdown; clicking it no longer also opens the source (the click was missing `stopPropagation`) (#726)
- Docker base image updated to **Debian trixie** and **Node.js 22.x** (#914)

### Fixed
- Podcast generation now uses the notebook's real content. `Notebook.get_context()` was missing, so generation ran against empty context; it now assembles source and note content as expected (#864)
- `PUT` profile handlers now use `model_dump(exclude_unset=True)`, so partial updates no longer overwrite unspecified fields with defaults (#860)
- OpenRouter embedding models are now correctly recognized via their embedding modality (#842)
- Search and Ask results now use page-level scrolling instead of being confined to a cramped, height-capped (`60vh`) bottom container, so the full result set is readable (#882)
- `POST /sources/{id}/retry` no longer returns `400 "Source is not associated with any notebooks"` for every source; it now queries the `reference` graph edge by its `in`/`out` columns instead of a non-existent `source` column (#861)
- `POST /sources/{id}/retry` no longer returns a `500` ("too many values to unpack") after successfully queuing the retry job; the command ID was being double-prefixed (`command:command:…`) before being saved to the source. Retrying a failed source now succeeds and updates the source's command reference
- `GET /sources/{id}` for a missing or deleted source now returns `404` instead of `500`; the handler caught `NotFoundError` in its generic `except` and mapped it to a server error
- Sources that fail to ingest (e.g. an unreachable or invalid URL) are now marked `failed` instead of silently saved as `completed` with the extraction error as their body. This means the "Retry processing" button (#726) actually appears for the most common failure mode; previously the job returned a failure payload but the command still completed, so the source never reached a retryable state (#726)
- Text search no longer returns a 500 when SurrealDB's `search::highlight` hits a "position overflow" on large or multi-byte document chunks; it now falls back to vector search and returns results (#648)
- `POST /api/search` now rejects a non-positive `limit` with a `422` instead of passing `LIMIT -1`/`LIMIT 0` to SurrealDB (which caused a 500 or a silently empty result set) (#863)
- Ollama `num_ctx` credential override is now persisted. The `credential` table gained a flexible `config` object (migration 15) and provider-specific tuning options are stored there instead of being dropped by the SCHEMAFULL table; future per-credential options can be added without a schema migration (#875)
- Worker no longer crashes on queued jobs from older versions; legacy embedding command aliases (`embed_single_item`, `embed_chunk`, `vectorize_source`) are registered and delegate to the current commands so stale queues drain cleanly (#695, #876)

### Performance
- Notebook source list no longer re-renders every `SourceCard` on unrelated state changes (layout toggles, context selection), and completed sources no longer each open a status-polling query. Both scaled with the number of sources and caused UI lag on large notebooks (#503)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **New audio providers**, surfacing the capabilities added in Esperanto 2.21–2.22:
  - **Mistral Voxtral** speech-to-text (`voxtral-*-latest`) and text-to-speech (`voxtral-mini-tts`), reusing the existing Mistral credential (#827)
  - **Deepgram** text-to-speech (Aura voice catalog) as a new provider (`DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`) (#827)
  - **xAI** text-to-speech (#827)
  - **Google** speech-to-text & text-to-speech, **Vertex** text-to-speech, and **ElevenLabs** speech-to-text (Scribe), completing the audio provider matrix (#828)
- Optional per-credential **`num_ctx`** (context window) override for Ollama models, configurable in Settings → API Keys and translated across all 13 locales (#825)
- `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE` environment variable to override the embedding batch size; default remains `50`. Helps with CPU-only local embedding and stricter OpenAI-compatible endpoints (#735)
- `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable to configure the API's allowed origins (comma-separated). Default remains `*` for backward compatibility; the API now logs a startup warning prompting users to set it for production deployments. Exception responses honor the configured origins when explicitly set (#585, #597, #730)
- `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_MIN_CHUNK_SIZE` environment variable (default: 5 tokens) to filter out degenerate tiny chunks before embedding. Set to `0` to disable.

### Changed
- Bumped **Esperanto 2.20.0 → 2.22.0**. Beyond the new audio providers above, this inherits several upstream fixes and behavior changes (see below).

### Inherited from Esperanto 2.21–2.22
- **Fixed:** OpenRouter LLM and embedding requests now send a proper JSON body (previously sent a malformed form-encoded payload).
- **Fixed:** OpenAI-compatible endpoints (e.g. llama.cpp) that return null embeddings now raise a clear, descriptive error instead of an opaque `TypeError`.
- **Fixed:** Streaming tool calls now return proper `ToolCall` objects across Anthropic, Google, Vertex, and Ollama.
- **Fixed:** `base_url` trailing slashes are normalized across providers, preventing double-slash URLs (and 301 redirects) for Ollama and other self-hosted endpoints.
- **Fixed:** Ollama "thinking" models (e.g. Qwen) now merge their reasoning content correctly.
- **Fixed:** Model discovery honors a custom `base_url` (LiteLLM/vLLM/OpenAI-compatible proxies).
- **Behavior change:** the Ollama default context window (`num_ctx`) is now **8192** (was 128000) to avoid out-of-memory errors on consumer GPUs. Raise it per-credential via the new `num_ctx` field if your hardware allows.
- **Behavior change:** the Google embedding default model is now `gemini-embedding-001` (the previous default, `text-embedding-004`, was removed from Google's API). If you used Google embeddings with the old default, re-create the model and re-embed your content (embedding dimensions changed).
- **Fixed:** Google TTS default model updated to a currently-working preview model.

### Fixed
- URL source embedding no longer crashes with `TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a real number, not 'NoneType'` when header-based splitters emit single-character fragments from complex HTML pages (e.g. Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg). Such chunks are now filtered before being sent to the embedding provider (#764)
- Language toggle now uses `t('common.german')` instead of a hardcoded "Deutsch" label, matching the pattern used by every other language entry (follow-up to #794)
- Speech-to-text model connection tests now transcribe a short bundled speech clip instead of silence, so a passing test returns real text instead of a blank transcription (#838)

## [1.8.5] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- Embedding chunking is now token-based instead of character-based, improving chunk sizing consistency for CJK and mixed-language content (#542, #749)
- `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_CHUNK_SIZE` and `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_CHUNK_OVERLAP` semantics changed from characters to tokens; default reduced from 1200 characters to 400 tokens to stay safely below the 512-token ceiling of BERT-family embedders (e.g. mxbai-embed-large) after accounting for tokenizer mismatch and splitter overshoot. Existing stored embeddings are unaffected; only new ingestions use the new chunking.

### Fixed
- Credentials endpoint no longer crashes (500) when encryption key doesn't match stored credentials (#740)
- Broken credentials are now shown with a decryption warning and can still be deleted
- DELETE endpoint for broken credentials supports model migration (`migrate_to` parameter)

## [1.8.4] - 2026-04-09
